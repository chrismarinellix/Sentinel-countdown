Subject: 🛡️ Introducing Project Sentinel - Win a MacBook Air This December!

Hi Team,

I'm excited to introduce Project Sentinel - our new continuous improvement program that's launching TODAY!

🎯 WHAT IS IT?

Project Sentinel is your opportunity to improve our business in ANY way you can think of. This isn't just about processes - it's about ANYTHING that makes Vysus better:

• Systems & scripting automation
• Client communication improvements
• Business flow optimization
• Quality and standards enhancements
• Competitive intelligence insights
• Anything else you can dream up!

Think outside the box. If it helps the business - we want to hear it.

🏆 THE DECEMBER PRIZE

We're kicking off with our inaugural challenge:

Prize: MacBook Air (or cash equivalent, or Windows laptop - winner's choice)
Value: Approximately AUD $1,500-2,000
Announcement: December 22, 2025

Winner gets to choose what they prefer!

🚀 HOW IT WORKS

1. Submit your ideas ANYTIME (no deadline - continuous submissions!)
2. Click this link to open the pre-filled submission form: [Click to Submit]
3. I'll collate and review submissions with our Sentinel team weekly
4. We discuss all ideas openly as a panel
5. Best business improvement wins the December prize!

This is collaborative and friendly - we review ideas together, provide feedback, and help refine concepts. Stay engaged throughout the process!

🛡️ WHO ARE THE SENTINELS?

The Sentinel PROGRAM is everyone - we're all on this continuous improvement journey together.

The Sentinel TEAM are the facilitators who help review submissions:

🇲🇾 Malaysia: Amani Razif (Lead), Syafiq Ishamuddin
🇦🇺 Australia: Chris Marinelli (Lead), Dominic Moncada
🇮🇳 India: Faraz Khan (Lead), Abhinit Gaurav

Note: Sentinel team members can submit ideas too - they don't vote on their own submissions.

💡 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

We're not trying to change for change sake. We already have good processes. We're looking for:

✓ High-value, low-effort improvements
✓ Simple solutions that remove friction
✓ Ideas that save time, money, or effort
✓ Improvements to quality, communication, or flow
✓ Things that benefit the business across regions

Even small improvements matter. A 15-minute process change that saves 2 hours per project is gold!

🎯 THE SENTINEL PHILOSOPHY

We look at things through a BUSINESS LENS, not just a technical lens. We focus on:

• How work flows through the business
• Where friction points exist
• Quality of inputs and outputs
• Record keeping and knowledge sharing
• Standardization across Malaysia, Australia, and India
• Business continuity and efficiency

🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

• Submissions are ongoing - submit anytime!
• This is the manual phase - I'll review with the Sentinel team
• Full automated system coming in 2026 with quarterly prizes
• Selection is subjective based on business value
• Decision is final - we ask everyone to be good sports
• Tax obligations apply if you choose the cash option
• Ideas you submit help improve Vysus (whether they win or not!)
