# 🎯 Project Sentinel - Complete Point System

## Overview

Project Sentinel uses a **dual point system** that rewards both:
1. **Contributors** - For submitting and implementing process improvements
2. **Sentinels** - For reviewing and verifying submissions

Both groups compete **separately** for their own prize pools.

---

## 💡 Contributor Point System (Max: 200 per submission)

### Multi-Stage Milestone Structure

Every submission goes through **6 mandatory milestones**. Points are awarded **incrementally** as each stage is completed and verified by Sentinels.

| Milestone | Time Frame | Evidence Required | Points | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| **1. Submission** | Day 0 | No | **0 pts** | Idea submitted to platform |
| **2. Initial Review** | 0-7 days | No | **25 pts** | Sentinel reviews and approves concept |
| **3. Concept Approved** | 1-14 days | No | **25 pts** | Approved for implementation |
| **4. Implementation Started** | 3-30 days | **Yes** | **0 pts** | Work begun, evidence provided |
| **5. Pilot Completed** | 14-60 days | **Yes** | **50 pts** | Solution tested, results documented |
| **6. Impact Measured** | 21-90 days | **Yes** | **50 pts** | Actual impact measured and verified |
| **7. Final Verification** | 30-120 days | **Yes** | **50 pts** | Sustained improvement confirmed |

**TOTAL POSSIBLE: 200 points per submission**

### Bonus Points (Built into stages above)

- ✅ **Detailed Solution** - Increases chance of higher milestone scores
- ✅ **Implementation Evidence** - Required for stages 4-7
- ✅ **Measurable Metrics** - Required for impact measurement

## 🛡️ Sentinel Review Point System (Max: 40 per submission)

Sentinels earn points for reviewing submissions. This incentivizes timely, thorough reviews while keeping the advantage fair (they compete separately).

### Review Points by Milestone

| Review Action | Time Investment | Points | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| **Initial Review** | 10-15 min | **5 pts** | Review concept, feasibility |
| **Concept Approval** | 5-10 min | **5 pts** | Approve for implementation |
| **Implementation Verification** | 15-20 min | **5 pts** | Verify work has started |
| **Pilot Verification** | 20-30 min | **10 pts** | Review evidence, test results |
| **Impact Verification** | 20-30 min | **10 pts** | Verify claimed vs actual impact |
| **Final Verification** | 15-20 min | **10 pts** | Confirm sustained improvement |

**TOTAL PER SUBMISSION REVIEWED: 40 points**

### Sentinel Point Calculation

**If a Sentinel reviews 10 submissions fully:**
- 10 submissions × 40 points = **400 points**

**If a regular user submits 2 fully completed improvements:**
- 2 submissions × 200 points = **400 points**

**Result: Fair and balanced!**

### Additional Sentinel Points

| Activity | Points | Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Weekly meeting attendance | 5 pts | Per meeting |
| Facilitating adjudication | 10 pts | Per session |
| Mentoring submitters | 5 pts | Per mentoring session |

**Monthly cap: 100 bonus points** (prevents gaming through excessive meetings)

## 📈 Point Value Analysis

### What Points Represent

**1 point ≈ $15-75 in prize money** (depending on competition)

**For Regular Competition:**
- $15,000 prize ÷ ~200-1000 total points = $15-75/point

**For Sentinel Competition:**
- $5,000 prize ÷ ~100-400 total points = $12.50-50/point

### Time Investment vs Reward

**Contributors:**
- Full submission (200 pts): 40-80 hours work
- Value: $3,000-15,000 (if you win)
- Hourly equivalent: $37.50-187.50/hr

**Sentinels:**
- Full review (40 pts): 1.5-2 hours work
- 10 reviews (400 pts): 15-20 hours
- Value: $1,000-5,000 (if you win)
- Hourly equivalent: $50-250/hr

**Both are excellent value for time invested!**

## ⚖️ Fairness Measures

### Why Separate Competitions?

**Without separation:**
- Sentinels see all submissions first
- Could "borrow" ideas
- Could fast-track own submissions
- Conflict of interest

**With separation:**
- No conflict of interest
- Fair competition in each track
- Sentinels focus on quality reviews
- Contributors focus on quality ideas

### Point Balancing

**System designed so:**
- 2 excellent submissions = 10 reviews
- 400 points achievable in both tracks
- Time investment roughly equal
- Both roles equally valuable
